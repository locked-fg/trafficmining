        Package where all supporteds algorithms of the project are held.

        Each algorithm should be represented by at least 2 classes:
        <ol>
            <li>the algorithm itself which extends the Algorithm class</li>
            <li>a configuration BeanInfo class that describes the configurable 
                capabilities of the algorithm</li>
        </ol>

        If an algorithm requires to use more classes, please use either inner 
        classes or - preferred - create a sub-package and move all the algorithm's 
        classes into this package and reduce the visibility of the helper classes
        to the package level.
