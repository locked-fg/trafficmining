        <p>Package containing the simplex-visualizations.</p>

        <p>1 and 2d simplexes are very obvious while a 3d simplex is a projection of a 3d space into a 2d plane.</p>

        <p>Actually this package contains pieces of UI code that desperately need some refactoring!!
        This code should not be used as example code to learn how to write UI stuff</p>
